# PRO335_Wikipedia_Project
 A project for the PRO335 class demonstrating querying a Wikipedia DB

 Our idea for the project was to make our own version of "6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon"

 We parsed the wikipedia dumps, and uploaded the information to a Neo4j DB to create visual relationships.

Dependency Installation cmd:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
